<h2> The transition from elementary to middle school wonâ€™t be complete without the required materials. From elementary school to middle school, there will be a significant change increase in workload - there will be more homework assigned, and you will get homework from almost every class. With this influx, having the needed materials are an important part of being successful. For example, with an increase in homework, having a binder is crucial in middle school. In addition, having a binder is only part of the job - keeping it organized and neat is also necessary, and will make life much easier. Simply put, having all the needed materials and staying organized is the key to being successful throughout middle school. Having the necessary school supplies helps reduces stress and allows the transition to be smoother. To assist parents and students, teachers and faculty have put together a list of highly recommended school supplies. This list of necessary school supplies will be mailed out to all parents a few weeks before the start of school.  </h2>
