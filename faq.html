  <h1>What are the school hours at J.L. Stanford Middle School?</h1>
  
  <h3>School starts at 8:15 A.M. each day and ends at 3:00 P.M., except for minimum days every Wednesday, where students are dismissed at 1:45 P.M. There are also District Minimum Days, where all PAUSD students are dismissed early (at 12:25 P.M.), and J.L.S. Only Minimum Days, where only J.L.S. students are dismissed early (also at 12:25 P.M.). Students will not have lunch on campus, with a set time, on these minimum days.</h3> 
</p>
  
  <h1>P.E. Clothes?</h1>
  
  <h3>Another difference between Elementary School and J.L.S. is that students are required to wear P.E. clothes during P.E. This attire is athletic/tennis shoes, socks, navy blue shorts and a navy blue short-sleeved shirt. Shorts and shirts with the JLS logo can be purchased on Jump Start day. An alternative is to bring your own shorts and shirt, as long as they are navy blue and they follow the J.L.S. dress code. If the weather is cold, you can wear long pants and/or a sweater on top of the P.E. clothes.
</h3>
  </p>
  
  <h1>P.E. Locker Rooms?</h1>
  
  <h3>The P.E. locker room is the room next to the P.E. teacher’s offices. The girl’s locker room is next to the female P.E. teacher’s room, and the boy’s locker room is next to the male P.E. teacher’s room. Each locker room contains many lockers that will be assigned by alphabetical order.</h3>
  </p>

<h1>What will my class structure be like?</h1>

<h3>Attending classes at J.L.S. will be much different than elementary school. For example, instead of having one teacher the entire day, most students will have five teachers. Students will have one teacher for their English/Language Arts and Social Studies classes, one teacher for Math and Science, a teacher for Wheel, a Physical Education teacher, and a music teacher. Your Math and Science teacher will be teamed up with your English/Language Arts and Social Studies teacher.
Wheel is a rotation meant to show a variety of electives here at J.L.S. The wheel classes in sixth grade include Latin, Home Economics, Industrial Technology, Art, Computers, and Drama, and Communication. 
Music is required in 6th grade. Students are allowed to choose to be in band, orchestra. or choir. Music is available as an elective class in 7th and 8th grade, but is not required.

Each school day has six periods. Each class is assigned a number. Usually, core classes (English/Language Arts, Social Studies, Math, and Science) are classes one through four. Students will receive their schedule in the mail a few days prior to the start of school. JLS’s schedule can be very confusing, but it is easy to get used to. This chart shows the week schedule.</h3>
</p>

<h1>What is a binder minder?</h1>

<h3>The binder reminder is an organizational tool that all J.L.S. students receive for free on the first day of school. It contains a calendar with sections for each course that allows students to record all homework assignments, as well as extracurricular activities.. This helps students to keep track of school homework assignments and become more independent, as well as efficiently manage time. It also includes helpful classroom success tips, JLS rules and general information, academic resources, and the JLS class bell schedule.</h3>

<h1>What can I do during lunch?</h1>

<h3>During lunch, you have the option of hanging with friends outside, going to the library to read books, or attending a lunch club. 
Clubs meet at different times and days. Early in the school year, you will receive a list of clubs during the Club Fair, and you can sign up to clubs you’re interested in. If you decide to join a club later in the year, you can still attend. However some clubs have maximum attendee limits, and fill up very quickly.
For more information, go to the J.L.S. Club List: http://jls.pausd.org/default/assets/File/FinalClubFairList2013-2014.pdf
Note that this is the 2013-2014 Club Fair List: the 2014-2015 Club Fair List may be different.</h3>

</p>


<h1>How do I know where I can go during lunch?</h1>

<h3>The lunch boundaries are marked with yellow lines. That is about it.</h3>
