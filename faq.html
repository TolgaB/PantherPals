  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq1">What are the school hours at J.L. Stanford Middle School?</a></h1></font>
    
  <h3>School starts at 8:15 A.M. each day and ends at 3:00 P.M., except for minimum days every Wednesday, where students are dismissed at 1:45 P.M. There are also District Minimum Days, where all PAUSD students are dismissed early (at 12:25 P.M.), and J.L.S. Only Minimum Days, where only J.L.S. students are dismissed early (also at 12:25 P.M.). Students will not have lunch on campus, with a set time, on these minimum days.</h3> 
</p>
  
   <font color="blue"> <h1><a name="faq2">P.E. Clothes?</a></h1></font>
  
  <h3>Another difference between Elementary School and J.L.S. is that students are required to wear P.E. clothes during P.E. This attire is athletic/tennis shoes, socks, navy blue shorts and a navy blue short-sleeved shirt. Shorts and shirts with the JLS logo can be purchased on Jump Start day. An alternative is to bring your own shorts and shirt, as long as they are navy blue and they follow the J.L.S. dress code. If the weather is cold, you can wear long pants and/or a sweater on top of the P.E. clothes.
</h3>
  </p>
  
   <font color="blue"> <h1><a name="faq3">P.E. Locker Rooms?</a></h1></font>
  
  <h3>The P.E. locker room is the room next to the P.E. teacher’s offices. The girl’s locker room is next to the female P.E. teacher’s room, and the boy’s locker room is next to the male P.E. teacher’s room. Each locker room contains many lockers that will be assigned by alphabetical order.</h3>
  </p>

  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq4">What will my class structure be like?</a></h1></font>

<h3>Attending classes at J.L.S. will be much different than elementary school. For example, instead of having one teacher the entire day, most students will have five teachers. Students will have one teacher for their English/Language Arts and Social Studies classes, one teacher for Math and Science, a teacher for Wheel, a Physical Education teacher, and a music teacher. Your Math and Science teacher will be teamed up with your English/Language Arts and Social Studies teacher.
Wheel is a rotation meant to show a variety of electives here at J.L.S. The wheel classes in sixth grade include Latin, Home Economics, Industrial Technology, Art, Computers, and Drama, and Communication. 
Music is required in 6th grade. Students are allowed to choose to be in band, orchestra. or choir. Music is available as an elective class in 7th and 8th grade, but is not required.

Each school day has six periods. Each class is assigned a number. Usually, core classes (English/Language Arts, Social Studies, Math, and Science) are classes one through four. Students will receive their schedule in the mail a few days prior to the start of school. JLS’s schedule can be very confusing, but it is easy to get used to. This chart shows the week schedule.</h3>
</p>

  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq5">What is a binder minder?</a></h1></font>

<h3>The binder reminder is an organizational tool that all J.L.S. students receive for free on the first day of school. It contains a calendar with sections for each course that allows students to record all homework assignments, as well as extracurricular activities.. This helps students to keep track of school homework assignments and become more independent, as well as efficiently manage time. It also includes helpful classroom success tips, JLS rules and general information, academic resources, and the JLS class bell schedule.</h3>

  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq6">What can I do during lunch?</a></h1></font>

<h3>During lunch, you have the option of hanging with friends outside, going to the library to read books, or attending a lunch club. 
Clubs meet at different times and days. Early in the school year, you will receive a list of clubs during the Club Fair, and you can sign up to clubs you’re interested in. If you decide to join a club later in the year, you can still attend. However some clubs have maximum attendee limits, and fill up very quickly.
For more information, go to the J.L.S. Club List: http://jls.pausd.org/default/assets/File/FinalClubFairList2013-2014.pdf
Note that this is the 2013-2014 Club Fair List: the 2014-2015 Club Fair List may be different.</h3>

<h3>School starts at 8:15 A.M. each day and ends at 3:00 P.M. on every day except for Wednesday. Students are dismissed early at 1:45 P.M every Wednesday. Sometimes, there are District Wide or School Wide Minimum Days, where all JLS students are dismissed at 12:25 P.M. Students will have the option to eat lunch off campus on these minimum days. </h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What is the class structure for 6th graders?</h1></font>

<h3>Attending classes at J.L.S. will be very different than in elementary school. For example, instead of having one teacher the entire day, most students will have five teachers. Students will have one teacher for their English/Language Arts and Social Studies classes, one teacher for Math and Science, a teacher for Wheel, a Physical Education teacher, and a music teacher. Your Math and Science teacher will be paired with your English/Language Arts and Social Studies teacher.

  <font color="blue"><h1>What supplies should I bring to school? </h1></font>

<h3>For information regarding the school supplies, go to the supplies page for a detailed description of what is needed.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What are lockers, what should I put in them, and how do I open a lock?</h1></font>

<h3>Lockers are meant to store backpacks, school supplies, notebooks, classwork, and any personal items, as there is not enough space in classrooms. Lockers are outside of classrooms, usually nearby your second period class.
Locks will be provided on the first day of school for free, and can be replaced for six dollars if lost or damaged. Students will have to return their lock at the end of eighth grade, 
To open a locker, first rotate the lock three times, then spin to the first number given, clockwise, then rotate counterclockwise to the second number, and finally, rotate the number clockwise to the last number. Then, pull the handle of the lock out of the lock and remove it out of the hole that locks the locker. It may take a while to memorize the numbers and how to open the lock, but you’ll get used to it.
For a more detailed explanation, take a look at http://www.masterlock.com/pdfs/Master_Lock_Combination_Tutorial.pdf</h3>

An alternative is to bring your own shorts and shirt, as long as they are navy blue and they follow the J.L.S. dress code. If the weather is cold, long pants and/or a sweaters can be worn on top of P.E. clothes.</h3>

  <font color="blue"><h1>P.E. Locker Room?</h1></font>

  <font color="blue"><h1>Panther Camp</h1></font>

	<h3>Panther Camp is created for 6th graders to help them transition from elementary school to J.L.S. On the first day of the school, you will report to your homeroom classroom on the blue card which will be mailed to you.  Panther camp will be on August 21 and 22, which is Thursday and Friday on the first week of school (school starts on August 19, which is Tuesday). </h3>
</p>
	<h3>On Thursday, you will split into small group assisted by three to four eighth grader counselors </h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>Help for transitioning to Middle School?</h1></font>

<h3>For transitional help, be sure to check with the school counselors often! Remember to talk to the school counselor, Mr. Arya, for help. He is in the office. Remember, if you are in need, don’t forget to talk with your parents or other teachers for help. After a bit, you will be acquainted with middle school.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>Where do I eat lunch?</h1></font>

<h3>The lunch area consists of most of the school. The end of a lunch zone will be signified by a yellow line. The yellow line is not to be passed during lunch except for special occasions or passes. You can also eat lunch in the breezeway.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>How do I get school lunch?</h1></font>

<h3>This is similar to elementary school hot  lunch. Students will line up and wait until they reach the counter. There, they will select one main dish and up to 3 sides. Milk is available as a beverage, and is considered a side. To pay, simply take your lunch and sides to the end of the lunch line, and from there enter your lunch PIN number. Families will receive their PIN number from the info packet sent over the summer. If you forget your PIN number, simply ask the lunch clerk. Another way method of payment is swiping your student ID card.</h3>
