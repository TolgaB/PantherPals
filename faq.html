  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq1">What are the school hours at J.L. Stanford Middle School?</a></h1></font>
   
  <h3>School starts at 8:15 A.M. each day and ends at 3:05 P.M. on every day except for Wednesday. Students are dismissed early at 1:45 P.M every Wednesday. Sometimes, there are District Wide or School Wide Minimum Days, where all JLS students are dismissed at 12:25 P.M. Students will have the option to eat lunch off campus on these minimum days. </h3> 
</p>
  
   <font color="blue"> <h1><a name="faq2">What is the class structure for 6th graders?</a></h1></font>
  
  <h3>Students’ schedules will be given on the first day of school during first period. Attending classes at JLS will be very different than in elementary school. For example, instead of having one teacher the entire day, most students will have five teachers. Students will have one teacher for their English/Language Arts and Social Studies classes, one teacher for Math and Science, a teacher for Wheel, a Physical Education teacher, and a music teacher. Students’ Math and Science teacher will be paired with their English/Language Arts and Social Studies teacher.
Wheel is a rotation meant to show a variety of electives here at JLS. The wheel classes in sixth grade include Latin, Home Economics, Industrial Technology, Art, Computers, and Drama, and Communication. 
Music is required in 6th grade. Students are allowed to choose to be in band, orchestra. or choir. Music is available as an elective class in 7th and 8th grade, but is not required.
</h3>
  </p>
  
   <font color="blue"> <h1><a name="faq3">What is the class schedule?</a></h1></font>
  
  <h3>Each school day has six periods (except Wednesdays). Each class is assigned a period number. Usually, core classes (English/Language Arts, Social Studies, Math, and Science) are classes one through four. A few days prior to the start of school, students will receive a postcard telling them where to report for first period. JLS’s schedule can be very confusing, but it is easy to get used to. This chart shows the weekly schedule.The second time slot of the day is five minutes longer than other slots. This time is dedicated to the morning announcements. These will give information about the day’s lunch clubs, upcoming events, student recognition, and informative videos. 
On Wednesday, instead of having two periods after lunch like other days, there is a 40- minute period called W.I.P, or the Wednesday Instructional Period. A student’s W.I.P teacher will usually be a teacher they have in another period. During W.I.P., students will do homework or read. 
Every day except for Wednesday, students will have the opportunity to talk with their teachers or make up work during T.E.A.M, or Tutoring, Enrichment, Activities, and Make-Up, from 3:00 to 3:05.</h3>

  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq4">What supplies should I bring to school? </a></h1></font>

<h3>For information regarding the school supplies, see the supplies page for a detailed description of what is needed.</h3>
</p>

  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq5">What are lockers and what should I put in them?</a></h1></font>

<h3>Lockers are meant to store backpacks, school supplies, notebooks, classwork, and any personal items, as there is not enough space in classrooms. Lockers are outside of classrooms, usually nearby a student’s second period class.
Locks will be provided for free, and can be replaced for six dollars if lost or damaged beyond use. Students will need to return their lock at the end of eighth grade. 
For a detailed explanation on opening a lock, take a look at http://www.masterlock.com/pdfs/Master_Lock_Combination_Tutorial.pdf.</h3>
  
</p>


  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq6">When do I get my locker assignment?</a></h1></font>

<h3>Hallway lockers numbers can be found on the paper schedule received on the first day of school. If forgotten, locker assignments can be obtained from Mrs. Scherer.</h3>

</p>


  <font color="blue"><h1><a name="faq7">Do I need a P.E. uniform?</a></h1></font>

<h3>Another difference between Elementary School and JLS is that students are required to wear P.E. clothes during P.E. This attire is athletic/tennis shoes, socks, navy blue shorts, and a navy blue T-Shirt. Shorts and shirts with the JLS logo can be purchased on Jump Start Day. An alternative is to bring your own shorts and shirt, as long as they are navy blue and they follow the J.L.S. dress code. If the weather is cold, long pants and/or a sweaters can be worn on top of P.E. clothes.
</h3>

</p>
   <font color="blue"> <h1>P.E. Locker Room?</h1></font>

<h3>
The P.E. locker rooms are next to the gym. The girls’ and boys’ locker rooms contain many lockers that are meant to be used for storing P.E. clothes, as well as hygienic items such as deodorant and other P.E. materials. Lockers are also used to store normal clothes during P.E. class and items from other classes, like a binder, to save time.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What is the Binder Reminder?</h1></font>

<h3>The binder reminder is an organizational tool that all J.L.S. students will receive on the first day of school. It contains a calendar with sections for each course that allows students to record all homework assignments, as well as extracurricular activities. This helps students to keep track of school homework assignments and become more independent, as well as efficiently manage time. It also includes helpful classroom success tips, JLS rules and general information, academic resources, and the JLS class bell schedule.</h3>
</p>

  <font color="blue"><h1>Panther Camp</h1></font>

<h3>Panther Camp is created for 6th graders to help them transition from elementary school to JLS.  Panther Camp will be on August 21st and 22nd; the Thursday and Friday of the first week of school.
	On Thursday, students will be divided into small groups assisted by three to four eighth grader counselors. They will take sixth graders to fun activities which are designed to create familiarity with JLS, a sense of closeness with fellow students, and an understanding of the positive character that we hope all students will develop and live by while at JLS. In addition, students will be introduced to the entire sixth grade staff and given a tour of the school campus. Each student will be given a t-shirt, sports bag, food, and prizes.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What do I do if I need help?</h1></font>

<h3>If a student gets sick or injured during school hours, they should visit the school nurse in the office. If a student is feeling sad or troubled, they can speak to a staff member or counselor.  Students who have a misunderstanding with a teacher can work with that teacher to schedule a time to talk privately or arrange a parent meeting. If the student still needs help, they can talk to a counselor or an administrator. If a student needs financial assistance, they can go see their counselor or Ms. Scherer for help. Students whose locker and/or lock are broken should report it to Mrs. Scherer in the Guidance Office. If books or belongings are misplaced or missing, first check the Lost and Found. If it is not found, immediately go to the Main Office and report the problem to an administrator.</h3>
</p>

  <font color="blue"><h1>Where do I eat lunch?</h1></font>

<h3>The lunch area consists of designated areas specified by the campus map.  Ask a teacher for clarification. The end of a lunch zone is signified by a yellow line. The yellow line is not to be passed during lunch unless special permission is given. The breezeway is included as part of the designated lunch area. Students may be allowed to eat in classrooms if they have lunch detention or if they are attending a club. In the event of a rainy day, folding tables will be set up in the breezeway.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>How do I get school lunch?</h1></font>
	
<h3>Getting school lunch is similar to elementary school hot lunch. Students will line up and wait until they reach the counter. There, they will select one main dish and up to 3 sides. Milk is available as a beverage, and is considered a side. To pay, students will take their lunch and sides to the cashier and enter their lunch PIN number. Students can find their PIN number in the info packet sent to families over the summer. If a student forgets their PIN number, they can ask the lunch clerk or Ms. Scherer for their number. Students can also swipe their Student ID card or enter their Student ID number as an alternative method of payment.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What activities can I do during lunch?</h1></font>

<h3>During lunch, students have the option of socializing with friends and peers, going to the library to read books, attending a lunch club, or playing on the basketball courts or field. The library is usually open from 12:35-12:55. 
Clubs meet at different times and days. Early in the school year, students will receive a list of clubs. On the day of the Club Fair, students will have the opportunity to sign up for clubs they’re interested in. Students can join a club they didn’t sign up for later in the year with the approval of the club advisor. However, some clubs have maximum attendee limits and fill up very quickly.
For more information, go to the J.L.S. Club List at http://jls.pausd.org/default/assets/File/FinalClubFairList2013-2014.pdf 
Note that this is the 2013-2014 Club Fair List: the 2014-2015 Club Fair List may be different.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>When is the JLS Science Fair (2014-2015)?</h1></font>

	<h3>The JLS Science Fair will take place in mid-October, and while participating is optional, it is a fun and exciting event where students will get the opportunity to display their project and see other projects. This will also be a good experience to practice for the National Synopsys Science Fair. During class and at home, the student will have the opportunity to work on their project (commonly referred to by teachers as the H.S.E., or Home Science Experiment), once their proposal gets approved by the science teacher. From there, students will begin to complete their project boards, as well as perform their experiment. Poster boards will be provided for free. On the morning of the Science Fair, students will need to bring their project board to the cafetorium. The night of the Science Fair, students will talk to judges, teachers, and parents. Participating students will be entered in a raffle, and will have the opportunity to win different prizes.</h3>
</p>

  <font color="blue"><h1>How do I get information about what is going on at JLS?</h1></font>

<h3>School updates will be emailed regularly to parents who choose to subscribe to the JLS weekly newsletter. This newsletter recaps activities that have occurred during school, as well as upcoming events. If parents choose not to subscribe, the newsletter is accessible on the JLS website (jls.pausd.org). </h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What after-school sports are available?</h1></font>

<h3>There are many after-school sports here at JLS, including cross country, football, golf, volleyball, basketball, tennis, track and field, and wrestling. These are run by the City of Palo Alto Recreation Department.  Sign-up dates for these sports will be announced on the morning announcements.  All of the dates and signup information is mailed to parents before school begins. Sign-up is online, and for sports with a limited number of spaces, the first to sign up are automatically on the team. There are skill evaluations, but these determine team placement, not whether or not the student will be on a team at all. More information can be found on the JLS home page, under “What’s Happening” in the “For Students” section of the drop down menu.</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>What is Homework Habitat?</h1></font>

<h3>Homework Habitat, is after school every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, from 3:15 pm to 4:30 pm in the library. Here students can study and get help with their homework and other assignments. Students have access to computers, books, and other materials in the library to help them with their work. Homework Habitat is supervised by teachers who are available to help.
</h3>
</p>
  <font color="blue"><h1>How do parents update student contact information?</h1></font>

<h3>Contact information is essential to the safety of students. Students will not be allowed to attend class until all information on Infinite Campus is completed. This can be done by logging into Infinite Campus through the parent portal.</h3>
</p>

<font color="blue"><h1>Is there a safe bike area for me to lock up my bike?    </h1></font>

<h3>Yes, there are safe bike cage areas for students to lock up their bikes. Students who bike to school need to stay on the designated bike path to ensure safety.  Students should not ride their bikes or any other forms of transportation on campus during school hours. Once they arrive, students should walk their bikes into the cage and lock it. The bike cage will be locked about 25 minutes after school starts, and opened 15 minutes before school ends. JLS is not responsible for any bike thefts. Any theft should be reported to the Palo Alto Police Department (650-329-2413).</h3>

<font color="blue"><h1> Do I bring my musical instrument and P.E. clothes on the first day of school?    </h1></font>

<h3>Students do not need to bring their musical instruments or P.E. clothes on the first day of school. Teachers will tell the students when they need these items.   </h3>


<font color="blue"><h1> Should I bring my backpack with school supplies on the first day of school?    </h1></font>

<h3>Yes, students should bring their backpack and school supplies. A letter about what to bring to school will be included in the mailing packet sent before school, and can be found <a href=”supplies.html”>here</a>.   </h3>

<font color="blue"><h1>What if I am sick on a school day?</h1></font>

<h3>Parents or guardians of students who are sick on a school day should call the Attendance Office (650-856-5179) before school. Messages can be left on the answering machine at all times. If no phone call is made, JLS requires that a note from the student’s parent or guardian be brought back to the office. For absences over five (5) consecutive days due to health reasons, a note must be written by the parent with a physician's verification. Any absences that have not been cleared by a parent or guardian will be treated as cuts.   </h3>
