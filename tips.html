</p>
<li> That remind me… MASTER your lock the first day, or you will be doomed! Not really doomed but you get the point!</li>
</p>
<li> Make a good impression on your teacher!</li>
</p>
<li> There is no recess! ! But you do have time at brunch to socialize a bit, and at lunch, you can go to all sorts of cool clubs, CLUB ARE AWESOME!</li>
</p>
<li> Memorize your schedule!</li>
</p>
<li>Sometimes your schedule will get confusing at first, so it might help to write it on a slip of paper you can keep in your pocket and look at when you need help.</li>
</p>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you are lost, everyone will be happy to help you. </li>
</p>

</p>
 

 

<li>Turn in your homework; you have letter grades. </li>
</p>
<li>Go to dances! </li>
</p>
<li>Make sure to find your friends quickly on the campus or else you’ll spend forever trying to find them. </li>
</p>
<li>Join a club that interests you. </li>
</p>
<li>Stay alive! Middle school has challenges. </li>
</p>
 
 
 
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask questions. </li>
</p>
<li>Don’t feel like you are the only one that is lost, think about all the sixth graders that are also lost and confused. </li>
</p>
<li>Don’t forget that kindness is the norm. </li>
</p>
 
 
 
<li>Make sure to record you homework in your binder reminder.  I know that you can just use Schoology (you’ll learn about it), but sometimes it stops working, or your teachers just forget.  Plus, sometimes you get individual assignments, so they won’t post it anyways. </li>
</p>
<li>If you play sports, bring your own balls. </li>
</p>
<li>Lunch is really short, so pack smaller lunches. </li>
</p>
<li>Check Infinite Campus a lot. </li>
</p>
<li>There is no recess, so be prepared! </li>
</p>
 
 
<li>In total there will be 6 one hour periods a day, two before brunch, two before lunch, and two after lunch</li>
</p>
<li>You will have a five minute passing period to get between classes</li>
</p>
<li>At lunch there are going to be clubs sometime after panther camp. You can create your own club, find a teacher and ask him or her to host your club (make sure to ask near the start of the year) if the teacher you asked says no, ask someone else. </li>
</p>
<li>You don’t have to sign up for a club to get in; you just have to get there before the clubs fill up. </li>
</p>
<li>You have two lockers; you will be given a PE locker and an everyday one. </li>
</p>
  <li> Pay attention to your teacher!</li>
 </p>
   <li>Don’t panic. Breath</li>
 </p>
   <li>Use your binder reminder. Its your best friend</li>
 </p>
   <li>Check Schoology frequently</li>
 </p>
   <li>Be sure to use study guides so that you don’t fail on your tests.</li>
 </p>

 </p>
   <li>Have fun!</li>
 </p>
  <li> Keep your backpack in your locker</li>
 </p>
   <li>Ignore people who bother you during a test</li>
 </p>
 <li> Doing your homework is important</li>
 </p>
   <li>Recess is replaced by brunch</li>
 </p>
   <li>Join clubs</li>
 </p>
  <li>There are daily schedules</li>
 </p>
   <li>Study for tests and quizzes.</li>
 </p>
   <li>We get out early on Wednesday at 1:45</li>
 </p>
   <li>The brunch line sells foods and drinks</li>
 </p>
   <li>Breakfast is served in the cafeteria during brunch</li>
 </p>
   <li>Class periods are longer than elementary school</li>
 </p>
   <li>Use your pin number to access your account money to buy lunch and snack</li>
 </p>
<li>Know Where To GO! Lots of people, when they first get to JLS, are not familiar with the campus at all. And that’s okay- you’ll get a map! But if you get lost or hurt, you need to know where to go. It’s the easiest place to find- the Main Office! Make sure that you know how to get to the Office from anywhere in the school- they’re always willing to help you!</li>
</p>
<li>Find Friends!  Make sure that you and your friends have a place to meet on the first day. Chances are, you’re probably going to be in different classes- and, remember, there’s no play-structure!</li>
</p>
<li>Ask For Help! JLS runs thing really differently from elementary schools. Don’t worry so much about getting lost or forgetting locker combinations-Almost everybody has trouble when they first arrive! If you’re lost or confused, don’t hesitate to ask somebody what to do.</li>
</p>
<li>No Recess?! One unfortunate change from elementary school is that, here, we have no recess! Instead, we have a fifteen-minute break for brunch, when you can grab a snack and chat with a friend or read a book. Try to stay close to your classroom, or you might end up late!</li>
</p>
<li>Forget About It! Lots of sixth graders stress about forgetting locker combinations, or not being able to work a lock. Don’t worry! Your lock will be given to you during class, and your teacher will show you what to do if you’ve tried to unlock it but can’t. And no need to memorize your combo- write it down! You unlock your locker at least three times a day. You’ll be surprised at how fast you’ll stop needing to look at that paper with your combination on it.</li>
</p>
<li>GOOD LUCK!</li>
</p>
<li>No more play ground</li>
</p>

</p>

<li>More teachers</li>
