  <h2>IN GENERAL TIPS</h2>
</center>
<font FACE="cochin" size="4">
   Know Where To GO! Lots of people, when they first get to JLS, are not familiar with the campus at all. And that’s okay- you’ll get a map! But if you get lost or hurt, you need to know where to go. It’s the easiest place to find- the Main Office! Make sure that you know how to get to the Office from anywhere in the school- they’re always willing to help you!     
</p>
   Find Friends!  Make sure that you and your friends have a place to meet on the first day. Chances are, you’re probably going to be in different classes. And remember: make new friends, but keep the old,
     
</p>
   Ask For Help! JLS runs thing really differently from elementary schools. Don’t worry so much about getting lost or forgetting locker combinations-Almost everybody has trouble when they first arrive! If you’re lost or confused, don’t hesitate to ask somebody what to do.     
</p>
   No Recess?! One unfortunate change from elementary school is that, here, we have no recess, and there are no playgrounds! Instead, you will have a fifteen-minute break for brunch, which replaces recess, and when you can grab a snack, drink, chat with a friend or read a book, and just  take a break. This is also a great time to use the restroom. The brunch line sells foods and drinks, and during brunch, breakfast is served in the cafeteria. You can pay with your pin number to access your money, or bring cash to school. Try to stay close to your classroom, or you might end up late!     
</p>
   Forget About It! Lots of sixth graders stress about forgetting locker combinations, or not being able to work a lock. Don’t worry! Your lock will be given to you during class, and your teacher will show you what to do if you’ve tried to unlock it but can’t. And no need to memorize your combo- write it down! You unlock your locker at least three times a day. You’ll be surprised at how fast you’ll stop needing to look at that paper with your combination on it. So, don’t panic, and breathe!
